# HopeLanka
Hope Lanka Is a mobile application based on charity that lets volunteers to donate either 
money or items such as clothes, food, medicine, electronic items and education related things for 
needy people. When donors donate either money or items, we are expecting to transfer money or 
give items for the needy ones after ensuring whether they really need the donation. As everything 
gets expensive by each passing day, thereâ€™s a big challenge to buy the necessary books for students 
but through our application we are hoping to donate books that kids will be needing in studies. 
Medicine takes a huge part in our lives and due to the current situation, we are running out of 
medicines and the cost is quite high. So, it will be a massive advantage for the low-income earners 
to get the medicines for free. Furthermore, we are hoping to help people by giving food, clothes 
and electronics too. So what we do is we get the donations from the donors through the application 
and we are hoping to either collaborate with different clubs like Rotaract, Leo or distribute the 
donations directly. Likewise, we are hoping to help the community and put a smile on their faces.
